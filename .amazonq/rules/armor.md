Armor is a category of items that provide players and certain mobs with varying levels of protection from common damage types, and appear graphically on the wearer (excluding non-humanoid wearers). These items include several different tiers of helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots, which can each be placed in designated armor slots of a player's inventory for use. 

Armor points count for less as the attack strength increases: each 2♥ done by the attack reduces the effective defense points by 1 (🛡), but not below 20% of the armor points. In short, the stronger the attack force, the less the armor points protect the player.

    Minimum: the lowest percentage that the full set protects from a strong attack. Each point just protects 0.8%.
    Maximum: the highest percentage each tier protects.
    Protection: the fourth level adds 16 percent of protection to the final calculation.
    Increased toughness means less armor defense point reduction from strong attacks.

Armor defense points are controlled by an attribute, generic.armor. The player's current protection level is represented visually by the armor bar. The armor meter is affected by the particular pieces that are worn as well as the tier of the armor. The following table shows the number of defense points added by default by each individual piece of armor, as well as the total points added by a full set of armor for each material.

| Material     | Full set                        | Helmet / Cap        | Chestplate / Tunic   | Leggings / Pants    | Boots              |

Different combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.
